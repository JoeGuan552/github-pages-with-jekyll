Brag Sheet: I have been a member of the Tennis team for three years in a row.

I am the president of a committee called the Student Leadership committee for Junior Achievement.

I have maintained a 4.2 GPA in class for the past couple of years.

I also have a part time job as a tennis instructor for elementary schoolers up to junior high school students.
